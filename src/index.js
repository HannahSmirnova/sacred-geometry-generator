The user's intention is: "${userIntent}". Your response must follow these formatting rules: 1. Begin with a bold title using HTML <strong> <h2> tags, - the title must be at the top and underlined. 2. Provide a short introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the practice using HTML <p> tags. 3. Format steps as a clearly separated numbered list using HTML <li> tags with text-align:left styling. 4. Include specific sacred geometry shapes and the ways of engagement with them such as visualizing, drawing, meditating on, or arranging them - this must be a separate paragraph, so use HTML <p> tags. 5. Ensure the formatting is clean, readable, and visually structured â€” avoid dense blocks of text. 6. At the end, suggest a crystal that enhances the intended effect of the practice by using <footer> tags. Make sure the practice is effective, applicable, and doable.`;
